# Google Drive - Direct Remote Upload
Directly upload files from the web to Google Drive without saving them completely on the server before.
This is useful to upload files, which are bigger than the storage available on the server.

Sorry, the code isn't really organized and clear, it was only for testing. Maby I'll clean it later...

### How to use it:
- Rename "credentials/oauth-credentials_EXAMPLE.json" to "credentials/oauth-credentials.json"
- Download your oauth2 credentials in the google developer console and copy it in it
- Call the "index.php" from the console ("php index.php")
- Follow the messages in the console window
- Create pull requests to help with the development ;)
